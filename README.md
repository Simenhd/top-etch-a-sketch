# Etch-a-sketch

## Description
A game is Etch-a-Sketch.

## How to Play
On [launch](https://simenhd.github.io/top-etch-a-sketch/), you’ll see a 16 × 16 grid. Move your cursor while holding down the left mouse button to paint tiles in the selected color. You can switch between primary, rainbow, darken, and lighten modes. You can also toggle gridlines on or off and adjust the grid size—but be aware that resizing the grid will erase your current drawing.
